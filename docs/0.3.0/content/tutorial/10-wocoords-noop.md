## Without coordinates & noop channel

> Certain chart types have neither measures nor dimensions on the axes such as 
> treemaps and bubble charts. This is a case when the noop channel comes in handy 
> for grouping and stacking elements in these kinds of charts

### Treemap

> To get to a treemap, we have to detach all dimensions and the measure from the 
> axes and put two of them on the size channel, whereas the other dimension is 
> still on the color channel. Since the same dimensions are used in both cases 
> Vizzu will be able to animate between these states.
> 
> ```javascript
> chart.animate({
> 	config: {
> 		channels: {
> 			y: { set: null },
> 			x: { set: null },
> 			size: { attach: ['Genres', 'Popularity'] }
> 		}
> 	}
> })
> ```

### Bubble chart - stacked

> Getting from a treemap to a bubble chart is simply by changing the geometry to 
> circle. This bubble chart is stacked by the Type dimension that is on the size 
> channel - this is why the bubbles are in separate, small groups.
> 
> ```javascript
> chart.animate({
> 	config: {
> 		geometry: 'circle'
> 	}
> })
> ```

### Bubble chart - grouped - using the noop channel

> In order to show all bubbles as one group, we use the noop (no operations) 
> channel where we put the Type dimension from the size channel. The noop channel 
> enables that even though we have a dimension on the chart, that dimension 
> doesnâ€™t change any parameter of the chart elements.
> 
> ```javascript
> chart.animate({
> 	config: {
> 		channels: {
> 			size: { detach: ['Genres'] },
> 			noop: { set: ['Genres'] }
> 		}
> 	}
> })
> ```
