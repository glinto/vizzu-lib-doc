These features basically mean that you add or remove an additional dimension 
to/from an axis or another channel. As you can see below, there are some 
important things to keep in mind when you use them.

Letâ€™s stack together the elements by putting the Genres dimension from the 
x-axis to the y-axis. At the end of this phase, there are chart elements with 
the same color stacked on top of each other, which is something you would want 
to avoid.

By taking the Genres off of the y-axis, only one chart element remains for every 
color, and Vizzu automatically calculates and shows the aggregate value of the 
elements.

Note: Instead of taking the unwanted dimension down from the chart, Genres could 
have been added to the lightness channel to differentiate the chart elements.

To drill-down, the same category is put back on the y-axis, which results in a 
state that we suggest you to only use temporarily when in transition.

We group the elements by putting once again the Genres dimension on the x-axis.
